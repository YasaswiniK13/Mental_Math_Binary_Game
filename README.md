# Mental Math Binary Game
  Mental Math Binary Game is a system that can be used by a player to test himself/herself in their arithmetic addition skills. The player is checked for a password so he/she can log onto the board and start playing the game. In this game, a random number from 0 to 15 is displayed on the second right most 7-Segment display when a button is pressed. The player should observe the number displayed on the 7-segment display and should mentally convert the number observed into the binary version, then identify the matching number so that the sum of the two numbers is 1111 in binary. Player should then enter the matching number using Player’s set of toggle switches and then press the designated button. The number should be observed on the right most 7-segment display. The sum of the two numbers will be computed by the FPGA and displayed on the third rightmost 7-segment display device. If the sum matches 1111, the second leftmost LED will light up otherwise the leftmost LED will light up. There is a timer of 99 seconds in the game, this will start down counting from 99 to 00 once the player logged into the game and press the game start button. The player can check his/her skills as many times as possible within the time limit.
